# CountryIO API
---
`Fork of:`  [MeseretAPI](https://github.com/brookmg/meseretapi)

- This API gives out detail about a certain country when asked. Simply make `GET` or `POST` requests against `country` endpoint.
- If you are using a `GET` request, you should specify the country name with a query element `country`. _I know it seems duplicated._
- If you are using a `POST` request, you should provide a JSON body which contains `country` property with String value.


# `Todo`
- [ ] Add country code support.
- [ ] Show more up-to-date data
